8 June at 04:38 ·
I popped by Kheng Cheng School this morning to welcome lower primary students back to school.
I saw a steady stream of students, with colourful masks on, a certain spring in their step, and many accompanied by parents.
As they queued up to go through health screening at the school gate, I greeted the parents.
Several told me that their kids were looking forward to coming to school again, after 9 weeks at home. Masks were an inconvenience, but so far most were able to manage.
I asked my staff what was the attendance rate across schools today. The WhatsApp updates came in fast and furious as the numbers were submitted - 98%, 95%, 97%...
As I have always felt, the great majority of students and parents believe school is important, and want school life to resume, but safely and with precautions.
Still, I understand there may be some anxiety following the announcement of the 5 confirmed COVID-19 cases in 5 different schools yesterday. They were surfaced because of stepped-up surveillance testing for schools after the end of circuit breaker.
As we continue with this strategy, we must expect more cases to surface. While the case count may cause concern, it means that the strategy is working. Because it is only through more rigorous testing, that we can detect cases early, and stub out the risk of transmission.
This, together with greater social responsibility, with each of us playing our part, will help us keep our environment safer. This will be the new norm. It applies not just to schools but also our workplaces, and our social circles. This is how living with COVID-19 will be like - test more, isolate early, trace widely, and we can then get on with daily activities, with precautions.
As a teacher at Kheng Cheng School told her class this morning, we will learn to adjust, to live with COVID-19. We will all benefit listening to ‘cher.",true
244,"As we exit the Circuit Breaker period, the Government is stepping up testing efforts to identify COVID-19 cases earlier and quickly contain any potential spread in the community. As part of this effort, since 2 June 2020, we extended surveillance testing for COVID-19 for all school staff and students above the age of 12 who are diagnosed with acute respiratory infection (ARI) at first presentation to a doctor, instead of only for those with prolonged symptoms.
2. Since 2 June 2020, we have been testing school staff and older students with ARI symptoms. Amongst them, five have been confirmed to have COVID-19. These cases are part of the confirmed cases of COVID-19 infection in the community which the Ministry of Health (MOH) announced today.
3. Of the five cases, four are students and one is a non-teaching staff. They are from five different schools – Anglican High School, CHIJ Katong Convent, CHIJ St. Theresa's Convent, Geylang Methodist Secondary School and Hwa Chong Institution – and are not a cluster. The student from Hwa Chong Institution was last in school on 7 April, before the start of the Circuit Breaker. Of the other four cases, three were last in school on 3 June, while one was last in school on 2 June.
4. All five cases displayed mild symptoms, with the onset of symptoms being 3 June for three cases, and 2 June and 31 May for the remaining two cases. While positive, the tests for all five cases revealed low viral loads. A repeat test using new samples showed that all five cases were negative. The evidence suggests that they were likely infected during the Circuit Breaker period, and not after school re-opening.
5. Like all schools, the affected schools have implemented precautionary measures to ensure the safety of students and staff, and minimise the risk of transmission. The five students and staff were screened on entry with no fever or visible flu-like symptoms. Other precautionary measures include spaced seating to ensure safe distancing, the wearing of face masks, cohorting by class, and minimising intermingling across classes and levels. The schools have also been thoroughly cleaned and disinfected, following confirmation of the COVID-19 cases.
6. Contact tracing and investigations are currently ongoing. Altogether, 29 staff and 100 students who were in contact with the confirmed cases in school have each been issued with a 14-day Leave of Absence (LOA) by MOE or Home Quarantine Order (HQO) by MOH. Those who are on HQO will also be swabbed for COVID-19 twice – once before the start of HQO, and once at the end of HQO.
7. The arrangements for all schools, including the five affected schools, will remain unchanged. This means that for this coming week starting 8 June 2020, for example, Primary 1, 2, 3 and 6 students, plus Secondary 3, 4 and 5 students will attend classes in school, while the remaining levels will be on Home-Based Learning, based on the earlier announced weekly rotation schedule.
8. Some of the students on LOA have registered for the Mother Tongue Language (MTL) examinations on 18 June. As their LOA ends on 17 June, they can still take the examination. The Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board will apply special consideration during grading for these students. They can also choose to take the year-end MTL examinations instead.
9. Our schools have implemented a set of comprehensive safe management measures to bring students back in a careful and safe manner. Nevertheless, it is extremely important that each of us exercises personal responsibility. We would like to remind all parents, staff and students that if a student or any family member is unwell, the student should not go to school. This is crucial to keeping schools going.
10. We would also like to assure all parents and students that while we expect from time to time to see such confirmed cases being reported through a more extensive COVID-19 testing regime, we will continue to quickly isolate those who are at risk of being infected through LOA and HQO. This will prevent transmissions and enable the rest of the school system to continue to function.

Soon they were catching up on their HBL experience with their Form Teachers, and sharing their concerns about keeping safe amid the virus and catching up on their academics.
The safe management measures took centre stage - compulsory temperature taking at the start of the day, designated staircases for different classes, keeping a metre apart and wearing face masks.
By recess, students had warmed up and settled down to routines, chatting enthusiastically – but from a distance.
And so it was for the rest of the day. During lab sessions, students were reminded to wash their hands and sterilise the lab equipment before and after their experiments. The students were also given fixed seating arrangements.
At Physical Education classes, the students cleaned their hands with hand sanitisers, then put the masks away in resealable bags. After that, they were free to stretch their limbs and sweat it out – at a socially safe distance, of course!

While Home-Based Learning kept learning going during the Circuit Breaker (CB) it cannot replace schools and classrooms, and the face to face (or mask to mask) interactions with classmates and teachers.

We can’t keep our kids at home for so long. It will severely impact their socio-emotional wellbeing and their whole person development.

First, MI takes in a wide variety of students from different backgrounds, including those who wish to try the A-level route after having gone to polytechnic.

Now that she is back in school, Janelle says she is glad to see her teachers again. “I prefer to be physically in class because the teacher will come over and teach you on the spot, and we can ask them questions and they will answer immediately. It helps me to better understand the concepts that are being taught.”
Online platforms are a way for teachers and students to stay in touch, but it’s no substitute for physical school and face-to-face interactions.
Ms Michelle Ling, who teaches P6 and P3 Maths and Science, says that being back in school allows her to provide more emotional support for her students.
“The students are more open to sharing their problems in person, because there is a greater sense of privacy. At home, the students may not want their family members to overhear their conversations, and they may not take the initiative to look for me,” says Ms Ling.
“During HBL, I do call them up regularly to check on their well-being, but it’s hard to tell how they are really feeling over a phone or video call. I can read their emotions better if we are chatting in person.”

There have been some concerns following the announcement to reopen schools come 2 June. Here are my answers to the top 3 questions:
1. My young child has problems wearing a mask for the whole day. Is there an alternative?
They can wear either a face mask or a face shield when in school or on campus. This is for their own protection and that of others. Schools will be arranging to distribute face shields to all preschool and primary school students in Term 3. Teachers will help the young children get used to the masks or shields with time. If there are special circumstances, teachers will also exercise flexibility.
2. I will need to work from 2 Jun, but my child is going to school only on alternate weeks. How do I plan for childcare arrangements?
I hope parents and families can try your best to work out a suitable arrangement. Companies should also continue to allow employees to telecommute to the maximum extent possible.
If you are really unable to make suitable childcare arrangements, please approach your child’s school for assistance. Schools will be prepared to extend limited care to young students on HBL but without childcare arrangements.
3. I don’t feel safe sending my child to school. Can he do HBL instead?
We will do our utmost to keep schools safe. We have a holistic system of safe management, comprising health screening for everyone entering the school, cohortisation of students, good hygiene practices and safe distancing.
But unless there are specific concerns arising from medical conditions, we cannot make attending school voluntary.
First, it is likely that COVID-19 will stay with us for more than a year, and until a vaccine is available. We simply cannot keep our children at home for so long. The impact on their socio-emotional and mental well-being will be serious. Having brought community transmission to a low and controlled level, we should resume school, reclaim a sense of normalcy, while taking many precautions.
Second, a voluntary system for parents is not good for the morale of both students and teachers. It segregates students into those whose families are able to provide care at home, and those who can’t. Teachers will end up having to juggle between classroom teaching and facilitating HBL for every lesson, which is not sustainable.
Lastly, keeping our children away from school does not guarantee that they will be safe from COVID-19 either. Family members have to go to work, and a large proportion of transmission to children has been from their family members.
Many countries have realised that school cannot be closed indefinitely, and are making plans to re-open theirs - even though their number of community cases is much higher than Singapore’s. By working together, exercising personal responsibility, plus maintaining high levels of personal hygiene and environmental cleanliness, our children can return to school in a safe manner.",true

As we exit from the Circuit Breaker from 2 Jun, we will embark on a roadmap to the eventual full opening of schools.
But the first step, on 2 Jun, should be a cautious one, to re-open schools safely. We will progressively bring back students to schools and Institutes of Higher Learning.
How?
First, we will prioritise the return of those who need a higher level of care, like students in Special Education schools, as well as graduating cohorts who need to prepare for national exams.
Second, for students not in graduating cohorts, we will have a weekly rotation system so that different levels of students take turns to come to school and to do HBL. So for primary school, it will be P4 and P5 coming back to school and P1, P2, P3 doing HBL in week 1, and the reverse in Week 2. P6 will come back every day.
We aim to gradually have all students fully back in school after two cycles of weekly rotation, or four weeks.
We will also continue to support high needs students and children of parents who need to work and cannot find alternate childcare arrangement, and allow them to come to school on their HBL week.
Many students will be excited to return to school. Parents may be looking forward to school opening too, especially if they have to return to work. But I am sure parents are also worried about their children’s safety. Rest assured that we will take whatever precautions we can to ensure the well-being of all students and staff.
Third, we will implement a stringent safe management system, including screening of anyone who comes into schools, good hygiene habits, group separation to prevent inter-mingling of students from different classes, and safe distancing which includes the wearing masks/face shields by teachers and students.
COVID-19 will be with us for some time. Let us take the necessary steps and precautions, to regain our lives as much as possible.

We embarked on the Early Admissions Exercise (EAE) journey in 2015, to move away from an over emphasis on academic grades, and to allow admission into polytechnics and ITE based on aptitude and interest.
In 2017, we admitted our first batch of students via this pathway. It was well received and we expanded the quota over the years.
And because learning never ends, in 2020 we extended the EAE pathway to working adults who wished to pursue a full-time education in our polytechnics after gaining some experience in industry.
The EAE represents an important change in our education system. So it should go on, in spite of COVID-19. Selections will go online for most courses, while those which cannot will be done on-campus with safe distancing measures in place.
Applications will open from 27 May for ITE and 8 June for Polytechnics. Details here: https://www.moe.gov.sg/news/press-releases/start-of-2020-early-admissions-exercise-for-the-institute-of-technical-education-and-polytechnics",true

The Direct School Admission (DSA) exercise for admission to secondary schools and junior colleges will open for applications tomorrow, 12 May.
Due to Circuit Breaker measures, the way schools evaluate applications will have to change.
Interviews and auditions, starting from end-June to Sep, will take place through electronic modes in the applicants’ own primary or secondary school.
Sports trials will not be possible and the NSG has been suspended. That means schools will need to place less emphasis on timings or competition placements, but assess students’ aptitude and potential through their track records, and demonstration of interest and passion, in as fair and transparent a manner as possible. It may mean some change in the school’s definition of a young sportsperson, which may not be a bad thing.
This will be in line with the objective of the DSA - to provide an admission pathway that is beyond academics, that focuses on potential and encourages excellence.

342,"Before the circuit breaker period, Dillon Mack’s days were typical of most Secondary 4 students – largely occupied by lessons and CCA, with the time in between spent catching up with friends, chatting about school and discussing their upcoming O-Levels together.
In the past month, students, teachers, parents and family members have had to adjust to new routines – Home-Based Learning being one of them. Here, Dillon lets us in on his thoughts on how life has been, and how he has improved his self-discipline.

Their teacher, Ms Renuga Konasegaran, encouraged them to learn new things and make good use of their time.
Ler Xuan picked up reading, Jovan took part in social media challenges for a healthier lifestyle, and Nivedita tried her hand at figuring out Rubik’s cube. These students all gained more than they bargained for while putting their time to better use at home.
And as their teacher, Ms Renuga led by example, of course... She learned how to make Nyonya kueh!

345,"Corrections and clarifications regarding a falsehood published by Singapore States Times on COVID-19 cases in schools
1. There is a false statement of fact contained in a Facebook post by Singapore States Times (SST) on COVID-19 cases in schools.
Falsehood
2. On 4 May 2020, SST published a Facebook post stating that “Education Minister Ong Ye Kung is responsible for numerous infections in schools after he refused to close down the schools. The schools were only closed on April 3rd, but at least 50 students and teachers were already infected.”These statements imply that at least 50 students and teachers had become infected with COVID-19 by 3 April 2020 as a result of transmission in schools, which is false.
3. As of 3 April 2020, 69 students and staff in MOE schools, including the Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs), were reported to have been infected with COVID-19. Based on contact tracing and investigations by MOH, all the cases (except for 3 which are still unlinked) were attributed to transmission via overseas travel, within households, social settings, and a non-school workplace (for a part-time student). In short, none of the 69 infections were traced back to MOE schools, including the IHLs.
Additional Clarifications
4. Even before the implementation of Full Home-Based Learning (HBL) as part of the broader national Circuit Breaker measures, our schools and teachers have put in tremendous effort to ensure that our students can learn in a safe environment. Precautionary measures included establishing new hygiene and cleaning routines for our students, fixed seating and assigned play areas, suspension of co-curricular activities, and placing students who are unwell, have a travel history, or who stay with family members who have a travel history, on a Leave of Absence.
5. As part of the national Circuit Breaker measures, schools were closed and we moved to Full HBL on 8 April 2020. With most parents telecommuting from home, the closure of schools did not become a major disruption to our lives. Although students no longer attend school physically, the restrictions in place prevented them from moving around the community freely and exposing themselves to the virus. Nevertheless, a major concern with school closure is our students from vulnerable backgrounds, who need the support of schools for lessons, meals and guidance. These students, together with students whose parents work in essential services, have therefore been allowed to come back to school for care and supervision, with the necessary safe distancing measures in place. The arrangements for these students will continue during the May school holidays.
6. If MOE had simply closed schools early, say from Feb 2020, we would have disrupted lives significantly, and the impact on students from vulnerable backgrounds would have been immense. Instead, we have kept schools open as long as possible, while keeping our students safe.

355,"Supporting students in financial need: School meal subsidies will continue till the end of the Circuit Breaker extension.
We had earlier provided school meal subsidies in the form of School Smartcard top-ups to all Primary and Secondary students from low-income families during the period of Full Home-Based Learning. This coincided with the original Circuit Breaker period which was up to 4 May 2020. We are grateful that the Community Foundation of Singapore (CFS) had come in as a partner for this effort earlier.
The Circuit Breaker period is now extended by another 4 weeks to 1 June 2020, and the mid-year school break will be advanced to May. Typically, meal subsidies are not provided during school holidays. However, given the exceptional circumstances this year, together with the Straits Times School Pocket Money Fund (STSPMF), we have decided to continue providing meal subsidies through School Smartcard top-ups during this mid-year holidays. STSPMF has committed up to $2 million for this effort. Depending on the amount utilised, the contribution by STSPMF will be matched dollar for dollar by MOE.
This top-up is expected to help more than 47,000 Primary and Secondary students on the MOE Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS), MOE Independent School Bursary (ISB), and Special Education (SPED) FAS, who have been receiving meal subsidies during school term.
